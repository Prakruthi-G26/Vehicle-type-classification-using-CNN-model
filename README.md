# Vehicle-type-classification-using-CNN-model
This a deep learning project developed for experiential learning evaluation. Vehicle type classification using CNN model built using tensorflow and CNN model. Used vehicles open image dataset from roboflow. 

- Developed an end-to-end CNN model for multi-class vehicle classification.
- Preprocessed and augmented input images for improved feature learning.
- Trained and validated the model using labeled vehicle datasets.
- Employed hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
- Generated accurate predictions for vehicle types based on traffic images.
